This was a course project from COMP4901K Machine Learning for Natural Language Processing at HKUST. It aimed to find and train a model to perform the NER labeling task for a COVID-19 related corpus. After testing with simple NNs and several kinds of RNNs, a bi-directional GRU network with a preceding embedding layer, which had a relatively huge dimension, was chosen to conduct the NER task. The resulting accuracy on the validation set was around 0.9049.
