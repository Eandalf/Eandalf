Associated with The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

Sep. 2019 ~ Dec. 2019

This was a course project from COMP3111H Honors Software Engineering at HKUST. We built an interesting window game called Tower Defense which reproduced the popular game genre as it was named. It was built with Java, and we utilized JavaFX for GUI, Timer class (java.util.Timer) for defining and changing the time frame of the game flow, Hibernate for persistence (JPA, data storage) toward MySQL database, and Spring Boot for the remote server service. We also utilized JUnit for unit testing.
