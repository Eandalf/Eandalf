## Hi There ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi, I am Jim. I am a software developer mainly working on JS/TS stack and, sometimes, on Golang in Taiwan. I develop frontend and backend software, from interfaces for user interactions to API for data retrieval and authentication/authorization, which complies with RESTful design guidelines. I started my journey of coding with JavaScipt. After that, I coded with C, C++, Java, C#, Python, PHP, and JavaScript during my studies at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology for courses and projects. In my first internship at TECO Electric & Machinery Co., Ltd., I mainly worked on an API service built upon Express.js, which acted as a layer between AGV robots and other services, such as a frontend control panel and third-party services. In my second internship at MVP Fastlane, initially, I worked with a team to help an online hotel booking service from a minimal viable product (MVP) exit the beta phase for a more mature system to accommodate more hotel providers and more users. The service was successfully launched, and its business model proved sustainable and profitable. During a tourism event, the service could scale up for a high volume of incoming requests. Our team monitored the system to ensure the traffic was being properly handled during the event. After releasing the project, I was appointed to develop a chatting app and maintain a tool utility app. The chatting app used SMS OTP for authentication, and the messages were transmitted by using WebSocket with the help of the Socket.IO package. On the other hand, the tool utility app had the login function integrated with the client's Wix-based website for seamless transferring between devices and platforms. Those apps both reached the goal of MVP for the demo and further phases of development.

I am currently working on several projects.

- "YouTube Clip Player": The project aims to solve the missing functionality of YouTube to collect clips of videos, curate playlists of clips, and a player dedicated to playing video clips. The project was built with Electron for cross-platform support and to demonstrate my skills in crafting a React.js-based app.
- ExpressGo: The project aims to recreate the middleware model developer experience with Express.js. It is an Express.js-like HTTP server written in Golang. API in ExpressGo aligns with the specifications of Express.js 5.x API.

I am starting a new position as a Junior Backend Developer in an on-premises cloud provider. I would mainly work between kernels and userspace applications with several cloud infrastructures to maintain and adjust.

### Programming Game (2020-21 FYP YIKE2)

Sep. 2020 ~ Apr. 2021

This project aimed to build a programming game to help teenagers and advanced learners learn Python more interestingly and competitively. We built the game by using Unity and .Net Core 5. For implementing Python language features, we did not take the text recognition approach, which would be specific to each challenge and could not scale well. Instead, we implemented a mini Python interpreter upon C# running on .Net Core 5. It recognized the tokens using Pegasus with the lexical analysis approach. After recognition, the interpreter built the abstract syntax tree (AST) using the information obtained from the tokens, with scoping, data types, and built-in functions taken into consideration and transformed into Node classes in C# to append to the AST. After the interpreter finished creating the AST for the whole code file, the interpreter used its evaluator to go through the tree and execute the statements. Apart from the interpreter, we created challenges and levels to guide the players from the basics of Python, basic data types, and operators, all the way to common built-in functions. To integrate the interpreter with the game built upon Unity, we lowered the .Net version to .Net Framework 3.x for compatibility reasons. To prevent players' buggy code, such as infinite loops, from blocking the main thread of the game, we isolated the interpreter to another thread, while passing the commands to and from the main thread using the producer-consumer pattern. The game created an interesting approach to learning Python with a real interpreter while conquering game levels and challenges.

### Pixel Inspector

Dec. 2020 ~ Dec. 2020

The project aimed to read the RGB or RGBA pixel values of the images locally. GUI was built with Tkinter. Matplotlib was used to load images. Numpy was used to manipulate arrays of pixel values. After setting up this project, we no longer needed to upload pictures to online services to inspect pixel values, which was commonly used in scientific research.
